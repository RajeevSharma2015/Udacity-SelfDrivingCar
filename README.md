# Udacity-SelfDrivingCar
Udacity Self Driving Car - Nano degree program and project works

#### Current Status of my course : Term-1 is expected to complete (Jan 2018)

## About Program & Core Curriculum
Program has three terms and each need to complete in time bound fashion of three months. Here is curriculam overview - 

### Part 1
### Computer Vision and Deep Learning

In this term, you'll become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data!

    Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
    Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
    Project: Behavioral Cloning
    Project: Advanced Lane Finding
    Project: Vehicle Detection and Tracking
    
Estimated time: 90 days 

### Part 2 
### Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control

In this term, you'll learn how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.

    Project: Extended Kalman Filters
    Project: Unscented Kalman Filters
    Project: Kidnapped Vehicle
    Project: PID Controller
    Project: Model Predictive Control

Estimated time: 89 days

### Part 3
### Purchase Term To Unlock
Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems



In this term, you'll learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, how the vehicle systems work together to get it there, and you'll perform a deep-dive into a concentration of your choice.

    Project: Path Planning Project
    Project: Semantic Segmentation
    Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
    Project: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car

Estimated time: 89 days
