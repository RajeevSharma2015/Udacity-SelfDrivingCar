#### CURRENT STATUS OF MY COURSE : Term-1 supposed to complete by FEB 2018

## About Program & Core Curriculum
Degree program has three parts (3 terms and 3 months each). here is details of [ Udacity core curriculam ] ( https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/syllabus/core-curriculum )

## Udacity "Self Driving Car" Program - Learning & Project Works Description 
### Part 1 : Computer Vision and Deep Learning

In this term, you'll become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data!

    Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
    Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
    Project: Behavioral Cloning
    Project: Advanced Lane Finding
    Project: Vehicle Detection and Tracking

Vehicle Detection and Tracking

Advanced Lane Finding

Vehicle Detection and Tracking
    


### Part 2 : Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control

In this term, you'll learn how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.

    Project: Extended Kalman Filters
    Project: Unscented Kalman Filters
    Project: Kidnapped Vehicle
    Project: PID Controller
    Project: Model Predictive Control

### Part 3 : Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems

In this term, you'll learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, how the vehicle systems work together to get it there, and you'll perform a deep-dive into a concentration of your choice.

    Project: Path Planning Project
    Project: Semantic Segmentation
    Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
    Project: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car

### Term-1 : Projects Sample Outcome Samples
This term was dedicated to "Computer Vision & Deep Learning". We learn finding lane lines on the road, classify traffic signs, driving behaviour cloning, advance lane finding, vehicle detection and tracking.

To achieve pre-decided goals of each project we need to deep dive into advance OpenCV images processing, Neural networks, Machine learning libraries and Deep neural networks. To explore further pl refer each project README & submission WRITEUP file. Few sampled outcomes are represented here !
